# CS448P2
This project (and those to come) will be based on Minibase, a small relational DBMS, structured into several layers. In this project, you are required to implement parts of the lower-level layers: BM - the buffer manager layer and HFPage - the heap file layer. Layers should be tested and turned in separately.

Team Members: Vani Daryani, Haley Klien, Pratik Bang
